# ArchFlow üåü

**ArchFlow** is a repository aimed at centralizing and providing **actions**, **workflows**, and **templates** for the CI/CD of various projects.

The goal is to automate repetitive tasks, ensure best practices, and simplify the integration and deployment processes for software projects. Initially, the focus will be on **Python**, starting with workflows and actions for developing Python libraries and ensuring good development standards. Additionally, the repository will include reusable **templates** to help structure repositories efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status: Under Construction

üöß **This repository is under construction.**
This is the first commit, and we're starting from scratch. In the coming weeks, you can expect:

- Custom **actions** and **workflows** tailored to the needs of CI/CD for this repository and other projects.
- Reusable **templates** for repository structure, including:
  - Pre-configured directories for source code, tests, and documentation.
  - Default configurations for common tools like linters, formatters, and CI/CD pipelines.
- An initial implementation with support for **Python** workflows, such as:
  - Linting, formatting, and testing.
  - Packaging and publishing Python libraries with best practices.

As the repository evolves, new workflows, actions, and templates will be introduced based on project-specific needs.
